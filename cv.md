## About me:
The visual component attracts me the most in front-end development. Namely, that in the process of working on the layout, you can always see the result of your work.
My primary aim is to make accessible and beautiful products for users.
I like to be in a constant state of learning something new. I especially like to study what is the most difficult, as it motivates me.

## Skills:
* HTML5 and CSS3;
* Flexbox;
* JavaScript Basics;
* Bootstrap;
* Pixel Perfect;
* Figma.

## Code example: 
```javascript
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b;
};

multiply(5, 9);
```

## Work experience:
At the moment I haven't commercial development experience. But I have a final educational project completed at the end of the course "Web layout basics" on Skillbox. The educational project was created using HTML5, CSS3 and JS.
